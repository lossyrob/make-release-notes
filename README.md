# <del>Scala</del> GeoTrellis Release Notes Creator

#### Taken from scala/make-release-notes and modified for use with my GeoTrellis release process.

This project generates the HTML release notes for Scala.   Its goal is to be minimal and sufficient.   Not an ideal example of Scala code,
but perhaps shows off a few standard library APIs. Refer to [scala/make-release-notes](https://github.com/scala/make-release-notes) 
for original README.
